all git configs are either in 
1) global: in your home dir ~/.gitconfig
2) local: .git folder


-- git snapshots

git stores a snapshot of your entire repo per commit
i.e., a unique tree

but git deduplicates files that are the same across different commits
i.e., git only stores pointers

a commit is some info hashed by SHA-1
you can literally regenerate one: https://gist.github.com/masak/2415865

> find .git
inode busting on Unix

cat a file
-> bunch of nonsense; bcos git compress the contents to raw bytes

> git cat-file -p <commit-hash>
tree -> directory
blob -> file

commits, trees and blobs are immutable
i.e., if you change their contents, you get a different hash

a branch is a mutable pointer to a commit
a tag is a immutable pointer to a commit
